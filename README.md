# Bisection-Root-Finding-Application
## Project Description: 
"Bisection Root Finding Application": This application is used to approximately find the roots of a function or equation by dividing intervals into two equal parts using a method that changes the sign (i.e., contains a root). In the first step, the given interval is divided into two equal parts, and it is checked which sub-interval changes sign. 
In successive steps, the interval is further divided until the sign changes, and after the sign change, this new interval is used to estimate the root.
